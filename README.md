What Should We Watch is an interactive platform that is intended to help an individual find shows/movies to watch. 

The solution is to rank things that they have watched previously. They rank them head to head and decide between two at a time which one they preferred.

From there the application takes their rankings and suggests content that is the best match for their preferences based on their top rankings.
