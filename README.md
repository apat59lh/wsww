What Should We Watch is an interactive platform that is intended to help couples find shows/movies to watch together. 

The solution is to rank things that they have watched together individually. They rank them head to head and decide between two at a time which one they preferred.
They do the ranking individually so that their overall rankings are not biased towards one person.

From there the solution takes their individual rankings and suggests content that is the best match for both of their preferences based on their top rankings.
