What Should We Watch is an interactive platform that is intended to help an individual find shows/movies to watch together. 

The solution is to rank things that they have watched. They rank them head to head and decide between two at a time which one they preferred.

From there the solution takes their rankings and suggests content that is the best match for their preferences based on their top rankings.
